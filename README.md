## Project Overview

**Perplexity Clone** is a high-fidelity reconstruction of the Perplexity AI search interface, engineered to demonstrate advanced frontend capabilities and system design. Unlike a standard chatbot, this application functions as a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine. It actively searches the web to find real-time information, synthesizes it into a coherent answer, and provides precise citations for every claim.

This project showcases the ability to build complex, data-intensive applications with a focus on performance, user experience, and clean architectural patterns.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The core content engine does not rely solely on pre-trained knowledge.
*   **Workflow**: User Query -> **SerpAPI** (Google Search) -> Context Extraction -> **LLM** (GLM-4.7-Flash) -> Streaming Response.
*   **Benefit**: Answers are up-to-date and fact-checked against real-time web results.

### 2. Intelligent Search Aggregation
*   Integrates **SerpAPI** to fetch organic search results, news, and knowledge graphs.
*   Processes and filters results to extract relevant snippets for the LLM context window.
*   Displays sources in a carousel for transparency, allowing users to verify information directly.

### 3. Advanced Markdown & Code Rendering
*   Custom-built Markdown renderer using `react-markdown` and `rehype-highlight`.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Auto-detects code languages and applies **Atom One Dark** (in dark mode) or **Docco** (in light mode) themes.
*   **Smart Copying**: Code blocks feature one-click copy functionality with visual feedback.

### 4. Robust State Management
*   Uses **Zustand** for global state, managing chat history, active sessions, and UI preferences.
*   **Persistence**: Automatically saves conversation history to local storage, ensuring users pick up exactly where they left off.

### 5. Secure Authentication
*   Integrated **Clerk** authentication for secure sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
*   Protects routes and associates chat history with specific user identities.

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a modular, component-driven architecture designed for scalability.

## Technology Stack Justification

### React 19 & Vite
Chosen for the modern concurrent features and lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Vite ensures the development experience remains snappy even as the codebase grows.

### TypeScript
Strict type safety is enforced throughout the application. Interfaces for `Message`, `Source`, and `Conversation` ensure data consistency between the search API, LLM, and UI components, preventing runtime errors.

### Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS allows for rapid UI iteration and pixel-perfect replication of the original design. It also simplifies the implementation of the dynamic Dark/Light mode system using CSS variables.

### Zustand
Selected over Redux for its minimal boilerplate and intuitive hook-based API. It handles the complex logic of chat history and active conversation switching without unnecessary complexity.

### Clerk
Provides enterprise-grade authentication out of the box, handling security concerns (sessions, tokens, encryption) so development could focus on core product features.

## Why Hire Me?

This project demonstrates specific competencies relevant to a Senior Frontend Engineer role:

1.  **System Design**: I didn't just build a UI; I architected a functional RAG pipeline on the client side, handling asynchronous data dependencies (Search -> LLM) efficiently.
2.  **Complex State**: The application manages fleeting UI state (loading, error) alongside persistent data (chat history, preferences) seamlessly.
3.  **Attention to Detail**: From the specific border colors in dark mode to the responsive behavior of code blocks on mobile, every interaction is polished.
4.  **Modern Standards**: The code utilizes the latest React patterns (Hooks, Custom Hooks), functional programming, and strictly typed TypeScript.
